#  Automated Backup Script — DevOps Bash Scripting Project

This project is part of a **DevOps Practice Test** where the goal is to **automate the process of taking file backups using Bash scripting**.  
It demonstrates core DevOps skills like automation, file handling, configuration management, Git usage, and working with real-world directory structures.

---

## Project Objective

In a real DevOps environment, engineers often need to back up important files, configurations, or logs regularly.  
Manually doing this every time is inefficient and prone to errors.  

Hence, the purpose of this project is to **develop an automated backup solution** that:
- Takes backups of any folder provided by the user  
- Reads backup settings from a configuration file  
- Skips unnecessary files and folders (like `.git`, `node_modules`, `.cache`)  
- Supports a “Dry Run” mode to preview actions before running the real backup  
- Logs all actions for traceability  
- Demonstrates proper DevOps workflow using Git and GitHub

## ⚙️ Files Explanation

### 1. `backup.sh`
This is the **main Bash script** that performs the backup operation.  
It:
- Checks if the `backup.config` file exists  
- Reads the configuration file to get destination and exclusion rules  
- Creates compressed (`.tar.gz`) backups with timestamps  
- Logs backup results into `backup.log`  
- Supports `--dry-run` mode to preview actions  

**Key Bash concepts used:**
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Reading variables using `source`
- String manipulation
- Command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`)
- Logging and redirection
- Timestamps using `date` command

---

### 2. `backup.config`
This configuration file makes the script dynamic — so the user doesn’t have to edit the script every time.  
It stores variables used by `backup.sh`.

Example:
```bash
# Directory where backups will be saved
BACKUP_DESTINATION="/c/Users/Dell/Desktop/bash practice/backups"

# File or folder patterns to skip during backup
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS=".git,node_modules,.cache"

# Log file location
LOG_FILE="backup.log"
How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Open Git Bash and go to your project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd "/c/Users/Dell/Desktop/bash practice/DevOps-Practice-Test/bash-scripting_test/test-1"
2️⃣ Give execute permissions to the script:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x backup.sh
3️⃣ Run in Dry Run Mode (to test without actual backup):
bash
Copy code
./backup.sh --dry-run /path/to/source/folder
Example Output:

bash
Copy code
[INFO] Dry run mode enabled
[INFO] Would backup folder: /home/user/documents
[INFO] Would save backup to: /c/Users/Dell/Desktop/bash practice/backups
[INFO] Would skip patterns: .git,node_modules,.cache
4️⃣ Run the Actual Backup:
bash
Copy code
./backup.sh /path/to/source/folder
Example Output:

bash
Copy code
[INFO] Starting backup process...
[INFO] Backup created successfully: /c/Users/Dell/Desktop/bash practice/backups/documents_backup_2025-11-03_11-30-15.tar.gz
[INFO] Backup log updated in backup.log
 Output Example
After running the backup, your destination folder (/backups) will look like this:

lua
Copy code
backups/
├── documents_backup_2025-11-03_11-30-15.tar.gz
├── pictures_backup_2025-11-03_11-32-07.tar.gz
└── backup.log
The .tar.gz files are compressed archives of your source directories.

 Logging Example (backup.log)
csharp
Copy code
[2025-11-03 11:30:15] Backup started for /home/user/documents
[2025-11-03 11:30:17] Backup completed successfully -> documents_backup_2025-11-03_11-30-15.tar.gz
This helps track backup history and troubleshooting.

🧩 DevOps Concepts Learned
Concept	Description
Automation	Created an automatic backup process using Bash
Configuration Management	Used backup.config to control script behavior dynamically
Scripting Skills	Practiced conditionals, loops, variables, functions, and arguments in Bash
Version Control (Git)	Cloned, committed, and pushed project to GitHub
Testing	Used --dry-run to verify results before execution
Logging	Implemented logging mechanism for debugging and record-keeping

🪄 Real-World Use Case
This type of automation can be used by:

DevOps Engineers to back up configuration files from servers

Developers to save project snapshots daily

System administrators to automate periodic folder backups

Teams practicing GitOps or CI/CD scripting

 Tools & Technologies Used
Bash Shell Scripting

Git & GitHub

Linux Command-Line (Git Bash on Windows)

Tar and Gzip utilities

Configuration-based Automation
